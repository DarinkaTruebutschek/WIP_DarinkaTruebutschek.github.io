abstract: 'Significance Our work tackles a current debate regarding working memory
  (WM). Traditionally, this ability to maintain and manipulate information has been
  thought to require conscious processing and persistent neural activity. Recent evidence
  challenges this assumption: Information may be briefly stored without conscious
  awareness and sustained neural activity. Here, we reconcile these competing views.
  We recorded brain activity while adults remembered or mentally rotated subjectively
  visible or invisible stimuli. We showed that the mere short-term storage of information
  may proceed without consciousness or persistent neural activity. However, manipulating
  information in WM during rotation required both. Thus, non-conscious, activity-silent
  maintenance is a genuine phenomenon but should be termed “activity-silent short-term
  memory”; when using a memory, a reactivation, associated with conscious reportability,
  is necessary. ,   Two types of working memory (WM) have recently been proposed:
  ( i ) active WM, relying on sustained neural firing, and ( ii ) activity-silent
  WM, for which firing returns to baseline, yet memories may be retained by short-term
  synaptic changes. Activity-silent WM in particular might also underlie the recently
  discovered phenomenon of non-conscious WM, which permits even subliminal stimuli
  to be stored for several seconds. However, whether both states support identical
  forms of information processing is unknown. Theory predicts that activity-silent
  states are confined to passive storage and cannot operate on stored information.
  To determine whether an explicit reactivation is required before the manipulation
  of information in WM, we evaluated whether participants could mentally rotate brief
  visual stimuli of variable subjective visibility. Behaviorally, even for unseen
  targets, subjects reported the rotated location above chance after several seconds.
  As predicted, however, at the time of mental rotation, such blindsight performance
  was accompanied by ( i ) neural signatures of consciousness in the form of a sustained
  desynchronization in alpha/beta frequency and ( ii ) a reactivation of the memorized
  information as indicated by decodable representations of participants’ guess and
  response. Our findings challenge the concept of genuine non-conscious “working”
  memory, argue that activity-silent states merely support passive short-term memory,
  and provide a cautionary note for purely behavioral studies of non-conscious information
  processing.'
