abstract: Abstract The ongoing reproducibility crisis in psychology and cognitive
  neuroscience has sparked increasing calls to re-evaluate and reshape scientific
  culture and practices. Heeding those calls, we have recently launched the EEGManyPipelines
  project as a means to assess the robustness of EEG research in naturalistic conditions
  and experiment with an alternative model of conducting scientific research. One
  hundred sixty-eight analyst teams, encompassing 396 individual researchers from
  37 countries, independently analyzed the same unpublished, representative EEG data
  set to test the same set of predefined hypotheses and then provided their analysis
  pipelines and reported outcomes. Here, we lay out how large-scale scientific projects
  can be set up in a grassroots, community-driven manner without a central organizing
  laboratory. We explain our recruitment strategy, our guidance for analysts, the
  eventual outputs of this project, and how it might have a lasting impact on the
  field.
