	abstract = {Working memory and conscious perception are thought to share similar brain mechanisms, yet recent reports of non-conscious working memory challenge this view. Combining visual masking with magnetoencephalography, we investigate the reality of non-conscious working memory and dissect its neural mechanisms. In a spatial delayed-response task, participants reported the location of a subjectively unseen target above chance-level after several seconds. Conscious perception and conscious working memory were characterized by similar signatures: a sustained desynchronization in the alpha/beta band over frontal cortex, and a decodable representation of target location in posterior sensors. During non-conscious working memory, such activity vanished. Our findings contradict models that identify working memory with sustained neural firing, but are compatible with recent proposals of ‘activity-silent’ working memory. We present a theoretical framework and simulations showing how slowly decaying synaptic changes allow cell assemblies to go dormant during the delay, yet be retrieved above chance-level after several seconds.

            Many everyday activities require you to store information in your brain for immediate use. For example, imagine that you are cooking a meal: You have to remember the ingredients, add them in the correct order, and operate the stove. This ability is called working memory.
            Researchers have long believed that, whenever we store information in our working memory, we are conscious of that information. That is, if someone asks you, you can report the information. Scientists usually also think that working memory comes with constant brain activity. This means that for as long as you have to remember something, the cells in your brain that code for that information will be active.
            Trübutschek et al. now show that we can sometimes store information in working memory without being conscious of it and without the need for constant brain activity. As part of the experiment, a barely visible square-shaped target was briefly flashed in 1 of 20 different locations on a computer screen. Human volunteers had to locate the square and indicate whether they had seen it or not. Importantly, they had to guess the location of the target whenever they had not seen it. While the volunteers performed this task, their brain activity was monitored using magnetoencephalography, a noninvasive technique that captures the magnetic fields created by electrical signals in the brain.
            Even when the volunteers had not seen the target, they could often correctly guess where it had been up to four seconds later, more often than would be predicted by chance alone. The experiment ruled out the possibility that this so-called “blindsight” was simply due to the volunteers accidentally reporting not having seen a target, when they had actually seen it. It also excluded the possibility that the volunteers guessed the location long before they had to report it and simply consciously stored that guess. Instead, without the participant knowing, the brain appears to have stored the target location in working memory using parts of the brain near the back of the head that process visual information. Importantly, this non-conscious storage did not come with constant brain activity, but seemed to rely on other, “activity-silent” mechanisms that are hidden to standard recording techniques.
            Although Trübutschek et al. show that the brain can unknowingly store information, they did not test other aspects of working memory. Future studies are needed to examine whether the brain can also non-consciously manipulate or use information in its working memory. In addition, future research also needs to investigate the exact mechanism that stores information without constant brain activity.},

            Our work tackles a current debate regarding working memory (WM). Traditionally, this ability to maintain and manipulate information has been thought to require conscious processing and persistent neural activity. Recent evidence challenges this assumption: Information may be briefly stored without conscious awareness and sustained neural activity. Here, we reconcile these competing views. We recorded brain activity while adults remembered or mentally rotated subjectively visible or invisible stimuli. We showed that the mere short-term storage of information may proceed without consciousness or persistent neural activity. However, manipulating information in WM during rotation required both. Thus, non-conscious, activity-silent maintenance is a genuine phenomenon but should be termed “activity-silent short-term memory”; when using a memory, a reactivation, associated with conscious reportability, is necessary.
          , 
            
              Two types of working memory (WM) have recently been proposed: (
              i
              ) active WM, relying on sustained neural firing, and (
              ii
              ) activity-silent WM, for which firing returns to baseline, yet memories may be retained by short-term synaptic changes. Activity-silent WM in particular might also underlie the recently discovered phenomenon of non-conscious WM, which permits even subliminal stimuli to be stored for several seconds. However, whether both states support identical forms of information processing is unknown. Theory predicts that activity-silent states are confined to passive storage and cannot operate on stored information. To determine whether an explicit reactivation is required before the manipulation of information in WM, we evaluated whether participants could mentally rotate brief visual stimuli of variable subjective visibility. Behaviorally, even for unseen targets, subjects reported the rotated location above chance after several seconds. As predicted, however, at the time of mental rotation, such blindsight performance was accompanied by (
              i
              ) neural signatures of consciousness in the form of a sustained desynchronization in alpha/beta frequency and (
              ii
              ) a reactivation of the memorized information as indicated by decodable representations of participants’ guess and response. Our findings challenge the concept of genuine non-conscious “working” memory, argue that activity-silent states merely support passive short-term memory, and provide a cautionary note for purely behavioral studies of non-conscious information processing.},

            Classical theories hold conscious perception and working memory to be tightly interwoven. Recent work has challenged this assumption, demonstrating that information may be stored for several seconds without any subjective awareness. Does such non-conscious working memory possess the same functional properties as conscious working memory? Here, we probe whether non-conscious working memory can maintain multiple items and their temporal order. In a visual masking task with a delayed response, 38 participants were asked to retain the location and order of presentation of two sequentially flashed spatial positions, and retrieve both after a 2.5 second delay. Even when subjective visibility was nil, subjects’ objective forced-choice performance exceeded chance level and, crucially, distinct retrieval of the first and second location was observed on both conscious and non-conscious trials. Non-conscious working memory may therefore store two items in proper temporal order. These findings can be explained by recent models of activity-silent working memory.},

            The ongoing reproducibility crisis in psychology and cognitive neuroscience has sparked increasing calls to re-evaluate and reshape scientific culture and practices. Heeding those calls, we have recently launched the EEGManyPipelines project as a means to assess the robustness of EEG research in naturalistic conditions and experiment with an alternative model of conducting scientific research. One hundred sixty-eight analyst teams, encompassing 396 individual researchers from 37 countries, independently analyzed the same unpublished, representative EEG data set to test the same set of predefined hypotheses and then provided their analysis pipelines and reported outcomes. Here, we lay out how large-scale scientific projects can be set up in a grassroots, community-driven manner without a central organizing laboratory. We explain our recruitment strategy, our guidance for analysts, the eventual outputs of this project, and how it might have a lasting impact on the field.},

However, this hypothesis has recently been called into question following the publication of some null findings. As part of the \#EEGManyLabs initiative, we set out to undertake a high-powered, multi-site replication of an influential study on this topic. In the original study, Mathewson et al. (2009) showed that during high amplitude fluctuations of alpha activity (8-13 Hz), the visibility of a visual target stimulus depended on the time the target was presented relative to the phase of the pre-target alpha activity. Furthermore, visual evoked potentials (e.g., N1, P1, P2 and P3) were larger in amplitude when the target was presented at the pre-stimulus alpha peaks, which were also associated with higher visibility. If we are successful in replicating the results of Mathewson et al. (2009), we intend to extend the original findings by conducting a second, original, experiment that varies the pre-stimulus time unpredictably to determine whether the phase-behavioural relationship depends on the target stimulus having a predictable onset time.},
